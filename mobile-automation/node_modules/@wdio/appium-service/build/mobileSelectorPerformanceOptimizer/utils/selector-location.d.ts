 * Searches for a selector in the test file and related page object files.
 * Returns all locations where the selector is defined.
 *
 * Strategy:
 * 1. First search the test file itself
 * 2. If pageObjectPaths provided, search those directories
 * 3. Otherwise, search related page object files (guessing from test file name)
 * 4. Return all matches with file and line number
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Only searches for XPath selectors (starting with // or /).
 * This prevents searching for optimized selectors like accessibility IDs or class chains.
